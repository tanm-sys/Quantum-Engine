# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions of the Quantum Engine. If you are using an unsupported version, we strongly recommend upgrading to a supported version to ensure you receive security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.x     | :x:               |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Quantum Engine, please report it responsibly. We are committed to working with the security community to verify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

1. **Private Disclosure**: To ensure the safety of our users, please report vulnerabilities privately by contacting us:
   - **Email**: [shrinathagre@gmail.com](shrinathagre@gmail.com)
2. **Provide Details**:
   - A clear and detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue, including code samples (if applicable).
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any suggested fixes or patches.
3. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and provide a resolution timeline within **7 business days**.

### Public Disclosure

We strongly discourage public disclosure of vulnerabilities until a fix has been developed and deployed. This ensures the safety of our users and prevents exploitation of the vulnerability.

## Security Updates

We regularly review and update the Quantum Engine to address security concerns. All security updates are documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/tanm-sys/Quantum-Engine/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)(coming soon) and communicated via the [Releases](https://github.com/tanm-sys/Quantum-Engine/releases)(coming soon) page.

## Best Practices for Users

To ensure the security of your Quantum Engine deployment:
- **Update Regularly**: Keep your installation up-to-date with the latest security patches.
- **Secure Configuration**: Follow our [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/tanm-sys/Quantum-Engine/wiki/Configuration-Guide)(coming soon)to minimize exposure.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive files and directories.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot).

## Security Features

Quantum Engine includes several built-in security features to help protect your deployments:
- **Input Validation**: Prevents injection attacks and ensures data integrity.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Supports robust user authentication mechanisms.
- **Encryption**: Utilizes industry-standard cryptographic algorithms to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Provides detailed logs for activity tracking and auditing.

## Known Issues and Limitations

While we strive for comprehensive security, the following limitations exist:
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are updated to their latest secure versions.
- **Custom Modifications**: Customizing the core system may introduce vulnerabilities. Proceed with caution and audit changes rigorously.
